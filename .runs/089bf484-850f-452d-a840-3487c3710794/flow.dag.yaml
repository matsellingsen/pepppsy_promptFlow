    default: Managed well over the holidays, but then experienced PMS. Cousin has
      been diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, read about it online, which caused
      significant anxiety and started a cycle of worrying thoughts. Couldn't
      find peace, had physical reactions, and concentration suffered. Went to
      work regardless, which was very difficult. Suspected severe PMS, agreed to
      increase Sertraline 7 days before the start of the cycle, otherwise
      treatment remains unchanged. Prescription issued, no indication of
      psychotic symptoms.
